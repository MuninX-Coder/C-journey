# 🚀 **Day 2 – Printing, Variables & Data Types in C++**

---

## 📤 **More on `cout` and `endl`**

```cpp
cout << "Hello world" << endl;
```

* `cout` → Used to **print stuff** to the screen.
* `endl` → Think of it as hitting **Enter** (moves to next line).

---

## 🔢 **Printing Numbers & Expressions**

```cpp
cout << "4" << endl;      // Prints the text: 4
cout << 4 << endl;        // Prints the number: 4
cout << 4 + 3 << endl;    // Prints result: 7
cout << 4 * 4 << endl;    // Prints result: 16
cout << "4 * 3" << endl;  // Prints text: 4 * 3
```

### ⚠️ Key Difference:

* `"4"` is a **string** (text)
* `4` is a **number**
* `4 + 3` does **math** before printing
* `"4 + 3"` would just print text, not calculate anything

## 📦 **Variables: The Basics**

### 🔍 What is a variable?

* Think of a **variable as a box** where you store a value.
* You can use the box later in your code by calling its name.

```cpp
int x;     // Declaring a variable x of type int (integer)
x = 5;     // Assigning value 5 to x
cout << x; // This will print: 5
```

## 🧠 **Common Data Types**

| Type     | What it stores                   | Example           |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `int`    | Integer numbers                  | 5, -2             |
| `float`  | Decimal numbers (less precise)   | 5.5               |
| `double` | Decimal numbers (more precise)   | 3.14159           |
| `char`   | Single character                 | `'A'`             |
| `bool`   | Boolean (true/false)             | `true` or `false` |
| `string` | Text (needs `#include <string>`) | `"Hello"`         |

## 🛠️ **Declaring + Assigning Together**

```cpp
int a = 10;
cout << a << endl;  // Output: 10
```

---

## 🧪 **Try This for Practice:**

```cpp
int num1 = 7;
int num2 = 3;
cout << num1 + num2 << endl;  // Output: 10
```
