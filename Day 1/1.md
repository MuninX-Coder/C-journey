# 🧠 **Day 1 – Intro to Programming & First C++ Program**

---

## 💡 **What is Programming?**

* Programming = Telling a computer what to do.
* You write **code** in a language (like C++, Python, etc.) the computer understands.
* It’s like giving step-by-step instructions to a dumb robot that only does what you say, literally.

---

## 📄 **What is `.cpp`?**

* `.cpp` is the file extension for **C++ source code**.
* Example: `myfile.cpp` → C++ file.
* You write all your C++ programs inside `.cpp` files.

## 🖥️ **First C++ Program Breakdown**

```cpp
#include <iostream>         // Header to use input/output (cout/cin)
using namespace std;        // So we don't have to write std::cout every time

int main() {                // Main function - entry point of your program
    cout << "Hello world";  // Prints text (no newline)
    cout << "Hello worls" << endl;  // Prints text and moves to a new line
    return 0;               // Ends the program
}
```

---

## 🔍 **Explanation**

* `#include <iostream>` → Lets you use `cout` and `cin`.
* `using namespace std;` → So you can just write `cout` instead of `std::cout`.
* `int main()` → This is where your program starts.
* `cout <<` → Used to **print output** to the screen.
* `endl` → Stands for **end line**, moves to the next line (like hitting "Enter").
* `return 0;` → Tells the system that the program ran fine.

## ✅ **Output of this program:**

```
Hello worldHello worls
```

(Because first line has no `endl`, both texts are printed on the same line)

---

## 🧪 **Try This:**

```cpp
cout << "Line 1" << endl;
cout << "Line 2" << endl;
```

### Output:

```
Line 1
Line 2
```
