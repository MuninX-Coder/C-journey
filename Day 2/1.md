🔹 Variable Initialization & Modification
cpp
Copy
Edit
int x = 5;
x += 2; → shortcut for x = x + 2

x -= 8; → shortcut for x = x - 8

x *= 10; → shortcut for x = x * 10

🔁 These are called compound assignment operators — saves time writing repetitive code.

🔹 Arithmetic Operators
Given:

cpp
Copy
Edit
int y = 2, z = 5;
Expression	Meaning	Result
y + z	Addition	7
y - z	Subtraction	-3
y * z	Multiplication	10
y / z	Division (int)	0

⚠️ Integer Division Warning:
2 / 5 = 0 (because both are integers, it drops decimals).
